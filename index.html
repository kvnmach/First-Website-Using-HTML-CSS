  <h2>Information about ARKANSAS</h2>
  <p>With its moderate four-season climate, variety of terrain, number of trails and natural beauty at every turn, Arkansas has everything you could want in a mountain biking destination. People are not only noticing this, but officially recognizing it. Arkansas features five Epic Rides, as designated by the International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA), which places us tied with Colorado for second in the country behind California with seven. In addition to these impressive trails, IMBA distinguishes the cities of Bentonville, Fayetteville and Hot Springs as Ride Centers for their world-class facilities and high standards of hospitality. Northwest Arkansas has been designated the first ever Regional Ride Center by IMBA.

It’s not a race, but The Natural State is well positioned as a leader in the field. We’re serious about cycling, just like you. Here in these pages and at <a href="http://www.Arkansas.com/bicycling/">Arkansas.com/bicycling</a>, we’ve compiled our list of local favorites with help from<a href="http://www.MTBProject.com">MTBProject.COM</a> , IMBA and mountain bike enthusiasts. These are rides you’ll come back to time and time again, because they deliver a different experience with the same familiar reward – the rush, the thrill, the exhilaration, the exhaustion, the feeling of accomplishment – with views you can’t find anywhere else.</p>
